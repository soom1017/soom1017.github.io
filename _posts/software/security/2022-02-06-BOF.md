## Intro
Here's hint file. It looks easy, though.

### Background Knowledge
A buffer overflow (bof), or buffer overrun is an anomaly whereby a program writes data to a buffer beyond the buffer's allocated memory, overwriting adjacent memory locations.

## Exploit
So, writing standard input to `buf` over 10 bytes, it corrupts other memory space.
There was dummy value between `buf` and `buf2`, and considering this, I got the access to the shell.
