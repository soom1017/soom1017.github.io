In the field of generative AI, especially on Compuer Vision part, [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) is on the rise. Luckily, I had the opportunity to attend to **Kias Summer School**, and gained insight into interpreting DDPM based on the Kalman filter.
