I'm attending [SWMaestro program](https://www.swmaestro.org/sw/main/main.do), and my team is developing a mobile financial news app "Temperature of Trades". In order to quickly deliver news that a user might be interested in, it is necessary to match the real-time updated news with relavant stocks, and go through processing like keyword extraction.
