I visited Kias for the first time, to listen to a seminar ["Geometry and Latent Representations in Machine Learning"](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/events/cray-colloquium-geometry-and-latent-representations-machine-learning). His view on how neural networks learn the representation of inputs, came to me curiously, so I read a related paper ["Classification and Geometry of General Perceptual Manifolds"](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031003).
